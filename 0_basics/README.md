Step 0: Become familiar with Rust basics
========================================

__Estimated time__: 3 days

Read through [Rust Book], [Rust FAQ], and become familiar with basic [Rust] concepts, syntax, memory model, type and module systems.

Polish your familiarity by completing [Rust By Example].

Read through [Cargo Book] and become familiar with [Cargo] and its workspaces.

After completing these steps, consider the following terms and questions. Try to answer and explain them providing useful context like examples, use cases are, comparisons.

## Basics
- What is Rust?
- What it is used for?
- Does it have a runtime?
- Is it compiled or interpreted?
- Pros and cons.

## Types & variables

- What primitive data types Rust has? What are their uses and properties?
- Name all the compound data types in Rust. Describe them.
- Constants, variables.
- Smart pointers.
- What is a type? *
- Static variables *

## Working with memory

- Stack and the heap.
- `Clone`, `Drop`, `Copy`.
- References, slices, lifetimes.
- Ownership and borrowing.
- Mutability.
- Pointers.
- Unsafe.

## Programming techniques (todo: naming)

- Expressions, statements.
- What is pattern matching?
- Where you can use it?
- Refutability.
- Matching operators.
- Dereferencing.
- Never type. *

## Error handling

- Runtime error.
- Compile time error.
- Error propagation, ? operator.
- Panic.
- Unwrap, when it's fine to use it.
- Useful shortcuts.

## Generics & Polymorphism

- Traits.
- Auto traits.
- Blanket impl, uncovered type. *
- Marker traits.
- Static dispatch VS dynamic dispatch.


## Bugs
Explain what these are, do you know how to avoid them?
- Memory leak
- Data race
- Use after free
- Deadlock
- Out of memory

todo: add some more (important) bugs

## Project structure

- Crates and modules.
- What is a workspace? Name the benefits of using workspaces.
- Visibility.
- How do you add dependencies to your project?



- What is an iterator? What is a collection? How do they differ? How are they used?
- What are macros? Which problems do they solve? What is the difference between declarative and procedural macro?


- Why [Rust] has `&str` and `String` types? How do they differ? When should you use them? Why str slice coexist with slice? 
- Is [Rust] OOP language? Is it possible to use SOLID/GRASP? Does it have an inheritance? Is Rust functional language?



After you're done notify your lead in an appropriate PR (pull request), and he will exam what you have learned.
